    // ToDo: As a cook I want to write how many hours I expect to be cooking (meal starts -> cooking starts)

    // ToDo: I want to add an image to my meal upload so others can see what the food may look like.

    // ToDo: As a cook I want to add the ingredients that are required for this meal, and indicate for how many people these ingredients are meant. That way we can calculate the quantities for more people in the future.

    // ToDo: As a cook, I may want to make changes and edit the description etc of a meal of mine.

    // ToDo: As a cook, I may want to delete an event of mine.
